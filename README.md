# django_rest_framework_simple_example
This fairly simple example of Django Rest Framework.

## Setup

I assume that you already cloned the repo and entered the repo directory

1. Enter the api directory:

```
cd api/
```

2. Run migrations

```
python manage.py migrate
```


3. Run the server:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

3, Go into your browser and enter localhost adress

```
localhost:8000/
```

The api helper should navigate you on what to do next.
